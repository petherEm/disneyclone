# üöÄ Disney Channel Clone - Inspired by Sonny Sangha (PAPAFAM)

A Disney Channel Clone.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with the following tech:

### Next.js 14

[Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) is the latest release of the popular React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

### Server Actions

Server Actions in Next.js allow developers to write server-side logic that can be directly called from the client. This simplifies building interactive applications by reducing the need for additional serverless functions or configuring backend routes.

### OpenAI

[OpenAI](https://openai.com) is a powerful AI platform that provides a range of tools for developers to build AI-powered applications. In this project, we use OpenAI's GPT-4o model to summarize and provide you the best recommendation movies.

## üîãFeatures

List down the features of your project here. For example:

- Dynamic pages and API routes with Next.js Server Actions
